<h1>Project Description</h1>

<p>
    Our project idea relates to the topic of global economy. The concept we came up with as a group is a game that simulates the real-world economy in order to educate the player. It will tackle many issues that arise with the international exchange of goods and services in which the user will be tasked to manage and take care of. To manage the economy, the user will be responsible to regulate the economy by adjusting aspects of it which the game will respond appropriately by correlating such changes to real-world events that have occurred. The goal of the game would be to show the user the potential life-altering effects just small changes have on the economy, and the very fragile nature of its existence.
    </br>
    It will be difficult to address all issues regarding the world’s economy due to the gigantic scope, so the game will feature the economy in general and also represent recent events, so it feels relevant, valuable and intriguing to the player. Current affairs that will be addressed will include but not be limited to: 
    <ol>
      <li>
      <b>The effects of diseases on global economy, including the recent Coronavirus pandemic.</b> The global economy is not exempt from the fear and panic manifesting as disease continues to spread across nations. </li>
        <ol type ="I">
          <li>Exportation and importation of goods and services will become restrained as supply chains cannot be accessed due to strict border limitations and small businesses will be suspended due to lack of revenue. </li>
          <li>The principle of supply-and-demand. Demand for essential items will rise however supply will remain stagnant which will inflate the prices while non-essential items will decrease as there will be less demand of such luxuries, thus negatively impacting companies that gross high amounts of money from selling such products. </li>
          <li>Because of the instability of the economy, the government will be pressured to fund local companies and individuals to keep the country from further breakdown. </li>
        </ol>
      <li>
      Similarly, <b>natural disasters are just as unpredictable and deadly to the economy.</b> With recent news of natural disasters, we can see that tons of resources and money are used to help recover from the crisis. For example, the devastating bushfires of Australia that happens yearly brings upon economic shortcomings. It brings great damage to industries such as farming and tourism, as there needs to be billions of dollars for the government to put down the fires and bring the place back on track.
      </li>
      
      <li>
      <b>Climate change is also a big factor that would control the economy.</b> The overuse of natural resources would have various severe consequences on humans.
      </li>
      
      <li>
      Overall, such natural phenomena have an acute impact on global economy as it can materialize at seemingly random times and send the global economy into turmoil in an instant. Depending on moderation, communities may not be well-equipped or prepared to deal with such disaster and it will leave an undeniably huge impact on the economy. 
      </li>
      
      <li>
      Something that also threatens the economy are <b>man-made causes.</b> Economic instability is encouraged by the ongoing tension growing between countries and regions. With different world leaders and prominent figures, they have a lot of power over the world’s economy and can manipulate it easier. With different people comes different motives, views, goals and policies regarding the economy which causes conflict between communities. This can bring about conflict, political uprisings, civil unrest and in the most severe cases, war. For example, in 2020, Brexit took a big shock to the economy. And shortly later in the same year the trade war between China and the United State caused more stock market instability.
      </li>
      
      <li>
      There is a concept known as <b>“debt wave”</b> characterized by companies and organizations borrowing money from the government in order to use it in their big project investment. This can have a positive effect on the economy, however from the statistics produced by The World Bank (2020), the world GDP has grown for 4% in 2019, but at the same time the debt has grown for 6%. As shown the number of debts is growing faster than the economic growth. This can produce another global financial crisis due to the big economic bubble made by this debt wave. 
      </li>
      
      <li>
      There are many more crises and causes for global economic pressure including famine, poverty, overpopulation, war, corruption etc. 
    There are many things going on, so it is important for use to understand the economic issue around us. With specific problems and scenarios discussed, the game will now have lots of content for the player to experiment with in order to educate themselves. The user will be able to control and monitor what occurs in the simulation, and therefore carry out sets of tasks to either fix the economy or send it further into destruction.

    <p>There are many things going on, so it is important for use to understand the economic issue around us. With specific problems and scenarios discussed, the game will now have lots of content for the player to experiment with in order to educate themselves. The user will be able to control and monitor what occurs in the simulation, and therefore carry out sets of tasks to either fix the economy or send it further into destruction. </p>
     
    <p>There will be two modes available in the game: one where the user can freely test and demonstrate events, and a campaign event where the user must deal with randomly generated events by the game and try to salvage the situation. For the campaign mode, the goal for the user will be trying to upkeep the peace of the world economy, and the game will end when the world goes into disarray or lack of adequate funding to spend, signifying failure. </br>
    Randomly triggered events can consist of natural or man-made causes. An example of a natural cause would be a tsunami hitting the coast of a very influential area, like Japan. The program, to be as accurate as possible, will retrieve information from Google of similar events and relay that data into the game for the user to interpret, and the user, with the role as a ‘world leader’ will decide how to deal with the situation. Actions that can be taken by the user could possibly be taking funds from somewhere else and funneling it towards the natural disaster relief. However, with taking funds from another place, there will be consequences, like that place going into instability or having severe losses. An example of a man-made cause could be the tensions arising between two areas, and them deciding to cut all economic ties. Just like the previous scenario, this would be out of the user’s control, and they will have to be able to work around the economic losses and keep sustaining it.
    </br>
    Ideally, the game would be crafted in a game engine suitable for beginner game developers. A candidate for this could be the Unity engine as there are many readily available resources, since it is a very popular game development software. As for the graphics for the game, our group can opt to purchasing pre-made assets, so we do not need to generate our own graphics, making the development stage much quicker and having much more refined graphics, versus having amateur self-made graphics. 
    </br>
    The game will have constraints as there is simply not enough data out there to predict what will happen when a specific event happens, as deviations can occur, and it is very circumstantial. But it will be a very good starting point for users who do not want to delve into news articles and want to take it slowly or educate themselves with a fun, interactive experience.

<h1>What does it do?</h1>
<p>This project is going to be a video game relating to the global economy. Within this game, it will focus on educating the players on how certain scenarios such as natural disasters, man-made causes and climate change affects societies and nations across the world. For this project, technology needed would be programs to create the textures for the game, coding, sounds and more visual aspects of the game. </p>
<p>The game will focus on more relevant events such as disease like Covid-19, natural disasters such as the bushfires in Australia and volcano eruption in New Zealand, man-made events such as Brexit within Britain which means we will have to track how the economy has been impacted by these disasters. Tracking the economy will give this project the realistic feeling it needs to be both fun, with help of controls and visuals, and educational.</p>
<p>The project over time will need to be developed accordingly to the correct effects of the scenarios, therefore researching appropriate reactions from each country and nations. This may take time as each country may react differently with their finances. Thankfully, news and financial research papers have swarmed the current media due to the recent outbreak of Covid-19 as it is currently a disease affecting every country currently. Data and correct implications will be at first hard to find as some cases are still developing but overtime during the creation of the project, it will become significantly easier to gather resources to create the realistic experiences. Some scenarios such as natural disasters will be easier to implement as there are many instances of these occurrences and the range of reactions from different regions and countries. This same logic can be applied to climate change scenarios and some man-made causes such as war. </p>
<p>Technology needed within the development of this project will include any type of gaming software, such as Unity, data pulling resources and texture making based applications. These said applications may update within the future with new and better improvements to the system to help without development of the project as these applications are quite popular. Unity being the main application to be used as it will build all foundation for the game we hope to invision during the project. A great aspect with Unity is the purchases of premade assets as previously stated as it will help junior developers get the understanding of programming, video game creation and design. Assets are readily available and will help with the timing of the project as junior developers do not have much time to create from scratch for their first project.</p>
<p>Textures within the project may need to be purchased as well if we do not have someone who is specifically skilled within the area of video game designing. Other than this option, we can hire and outsource if need be.</p>
<p>Features and information that can be done now is researching and gathering specific data necessary for the project. As it is based on scenarios around the world reacting to financial distress and economical issues. As the team and many others are currently going through a pandemic, this is a prime opportunity to gather resources for the appropriate reactions from each country and how they have handled losses financially and economically. Data is currently everywhere regarding pandemics as there are many different countries recording their net loss for businesses and their governments. With this, the project can easily have implements of this current pandemic.</p>
<p>Other possible developments that can be made is working with Unity to get an understanding as to how we want to make this project work, what scenarios can be made with the tools we have readily available and what we can do within the given time frame.</p>


<h1>What is the likely impact?</h1>
<p>The likely impact the project should have in the future of development of a range of people understand the effects of real-life events that take place on the economy. With this educational side, hopefully this can be implemented into some core learning atmospheres and shape people's mindset to think about the economical issues we face everyday. Hopefully, the completion of this game project will include scenarios influenced by relative topical economical crisis happening around the world such as the financial stress due to Covid-19. This can create a great simulation to teach how such important moments in history can drastically change the world for long or short periods of time.</p>
<p>The project will not put any jobs in redundancy but will in fact create jobs as we are a team of junior developers. Typically, junior game development studios will hire senior developers to help on the back end of projects as they are experienced in areas that juniors may not be, creating more jobs for freelance developers. Jobs available will be related to development, assets if we do decide to create them and coding.</p>
<p>During development of the game however, changes will have to be made as it is a relatively big game regarding the scope. Potential changes will be made such as cutting down on specific aspects to save time such as development of assets or textures. The scope as a project team we developed was rather large to give us a broader picture and bigger goal to work towards, but realising this may have been too large to work towards within the time constraint we do currently have. Cutting down on the time we are allocated, changes the dynamics of the goals we set in place as we have to make them smaller and reachable. </p>

<h1>How will this affect you?</h1>
<p>If the project is successfully picked up, the only impact I will be facing is the time consuming factor of this project. As I will be working on the project in various areas will be time consuming and impacting my time within the project. This will lead to less time spending on possible other projects and hopefully creates this project to be successful. This will go for all team members within the project as it will need multiple people in various areas. </p>
<p>With more team members onboard, impacting jobs to hopefully increase within the gaming industry will be ideal as the gaming space is expanding but also in demand.</p>
<p>The development time constraint will impact the team members as they will have to work within a specific timeframe. This can drastically change and impact the development of the project and team members within the game which could be stress related or possible delays in specific assets. If possible issues arise that can cause problems for the project regarding team members, actions will need to be dealt with as soon as possible to make sure development stays on track.</p>
<p>To expand more on other people who may have an impact would be the educational area as they could potentially use this project as a tool to teach children and teenagers during a business class the impacts on businesses. This can help students understand that finances can be crucial in what department they are in and how it impacts them and others. Hopefully, this project can be effective to be both fun and educational, impacting a child's education.</p>
<p>The biggest difference will be having a new junior development team working on a project slightly large will be a big achievement but also a stretch, hence the time constraints.</p>
