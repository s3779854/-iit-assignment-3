    <h3 style="text-align:left;"> Topic </h3>
    
    <p style="text-align:left;"> Our project idea is related to the global economy and the propose of this project is to educate the people by playing the game to simulates what will be happening in real-world economies. We currently have affairs in the economy, the things cause the issues are such as debt, natural disasters, disease, and more. Those lists of affairs are easy to cause to the economy in a bad way. Add to that even make small changes still has a big effect on the economy and people working. The statics produced by world bank (2020), the world GDP has grown for 4% in 2019, but at the same time, the debt has frown for 6%. As the evidence shown recently the debt is increasing more by year by year. Which represents the global economy getting worse every year. </p>
    <p style="text-align:left;"> Because the global economy's situation is getting worse, our project will be there to teach and let users understand by playing the game. To help the users to understand what will occur when they make a change. Also when we have some issues in society what will be caused to the economy. Our project it to simulates about the economy to help users to avoid making the same mistake in the real world and to what changes are needed to have a better global economy. It will help them to find out what is the best or right way to do to manage the economy without causing the issue and not increase the debt. </p>

    <h3 style="text-align:left;"> Motivation </h3>

    <p style="text-align:left;"> The motivation for our project is as we are under the coronavirus situation now, this lockdown by coronavirus is causing a huge loss for the global economy. Especially some companies like travel, because now lockdown we can't go to other countries, in this case, the travel companies don't have any money that coming in. The worst result that could occur will be bankruptcy. To avoid bankruptcy this project is important to change the situation they have in the global economy. This is really important to stop increasing the amount of debt every year. The global economy is needed for people to live because they are working for the company or shops to earn money. But if it keeps getting worse it means might be someone lose their jobs. And could be causing the issues for the exportation and importation of the product. Having enough is extremely important for stability that causes low crime levels and cultural, scientific, and technological progress. If we are able to work on the project it will help future employers to avoid keep having debt. And also can support their business to survive by doesn't need to tell employees to quiet the job. Can use this simulation game is to help educate future employers too. </p>
  
    <h3 style="text-align:left;"> Landscape </h3>
    <p style="text-align:left;"> The similar product to our project idea is Bussiness Simulation games. Something like 'Virtonomics',  this game is used for both entertainment and training development purposes. In the Virtonomics there are no predefined rules to winning or losing, and the game does not end. Although users can choose their own goals in the games to play towards to goal. Players can work within a multitude of industries, including agriculture, manufacturing, retail, finance, marketing, science, and other business processes. The difference is this game is more on Bussiness, but our project is more relates to the economy. And our project has a goal already, the goal for the user will be trying to upkeep the peace of the world economy, and the game will end when the world goes into disarray or lack of adequate funding to spend, signifying failure. Also, the events will be triggered randomly, such as Tsunami as natural disasters. The project needs to be accurate as possible and similar to the real-world as possible.</p>
