    <p> Because of the recent economy keeps getting worse every year. Therefore this project is there to educate the people working in the economy or become employers in the future to understand how to keep a good economy without having the big issues even natural disasters and diseases like Corona Virus is pandemic and suddenly some changes are needed in the real-world economy. Those issues are caused by having issues with the exportation and importation of goods and services. If they stop those services a lot of other services are limited. So this project is to aims to players understand the economic issues that occurred around us. </p>
    <p> The goal of the game would be to show the user the potentially life-altering effects just small changes have on the economy, and the very fragile nature of its existence.

    <p> Two modes in games aim to get familiar with something unpredictable. Something like the disease and natural disasters are can't predict. No one knows when it will happen and how much it will affect the economy. Therefore those two modes are for users to try and solve the issues, and how to make it better in the situation they had. To use the event accurately as possible in the real- world to help players not get panic when they are face to same unpredictable issues in the real-world. </p>
    <p> The goal for this mode is to the users will be trying to upkeep the peace of the world economy. To do this mode as accurately as possible it will retrieve information from Google or similar events that happened before and relay that data into the fame for users. And the game will end when the world goes into disarray or lack of adequate funding to spend, signifying failure. So the user can understand what will be occurring by what kind of action while playing the game that action was taken by the users. This is useful for users to understand how to keep the peace and worthful economy.</p>
