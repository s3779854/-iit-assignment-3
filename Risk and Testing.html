<h1>Risk</h1>
<p>It is very important to realise the risk that would occur during the develpment of the game and make ways to avoid them. For a project money is always something to consider. First we need to find a investor to fund the money so we don't run into a budget risk. After that the team need to put their ideas it to the form of a game. It would be kind of hard to implement everything in the early stage. Even if the feature of the game is plan out, when develping the game their is the chance of finding issue that are not identified earlier. Some conflict between the feature might be found during the process.It would be time wasting to go over everything and a huge struggle to meet the deadline from the investor. Even when releasing the game is quiet important to choose the right advitisement method, if the publicity is not in place, no one would notice the game, but if the feature in the advtiment don't show as advtised it would course bad effect too.   Furthermore the platform to release the game in will influence the popularity of the game. The game would not grant success if those requirment is not meet.</p>
    

<h1>Testing</h1>
<p>Game testing is the most important part in a game development process.It is crucial let the user have a feel of how the game would be like, so the developer can know that they are not put the work into nothing. On the other hand, testing also ensure the game don't have game breaking that would resolve in huge financial lost. Before releasing anything decide a suitable user group for the game. Then post survey out with good screener questions so it can reach to the relevant user group. And then anaylise the data from the survey. After finishing analysing the answer, find the participant that have interesting answer that you want to get in more deep.Find 15 to 20 and set up a interview with them and during the interview ask him in more detail and collectn their contact. After implement the change, contact the participant before, let them do an alpha test, and give them some task to complete, set time for each task, whethere they finish the task or not let them give short feedback after the time end. Record the process and result of each test. Put in the detail learned and make the final beta version.</p>
