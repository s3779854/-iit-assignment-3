<h1>Roles</h1>
<p>Our project is a game that simulates the real-world economy that aims to educate our potential players. In game development process, there is 3 stages- Pre-production, Production and Post-production so we will break down the roles that are important to this simulation making.  </p>
<br>
<p>For the first stage- Pre Production, a <b>Video Game Producer</b> is considered needed as they handle the business aspect of the project, they do the budgeting and develop a marketing plan on how the product will be sold to public. Another role is the <b>Concept Artist</b> who sets the tone for the project by developing the artwork which helps the language of the game.  </p>
<br>
<p>For the second process- Production which is the longest stage among the three. The roles that are relevant for this stage are: <b>Programmer</b> who write the logics and control of the game and making the user to relate and enjoy the game. Programmers needs to have strong programming background with a combination of creativity, and math skills. We need <b>Game Designers</b> which are the creative driver of the game. Their role includes creating characters with fantastic stories with goals on each stages, encountering challenges and applying rules. <b>Level Designer</b> creates challenges for each stages of the game. Their aim is to keep the player focused on the game and achieve the missions to each level. In this process a <b>Game Artist</b> is included, this role is similar to a concept artist. <b>Sound Engineer</b> is responsible for the sound effect and sound programming.  Lastly, Video Game Tester who test the flow of the game and check if the quality is on beyond satisfaction. Tester is the final person to get assurance for the game before releasing it to public.  </p>
<br>
<p>For the third process- Post-Production the roles that are needed for this stage are the people who will do the maintenance such as fixing bugs or downloadable content which is a programmers job. </p>
    <br>
<p>All of us are the concept artist of our project as we all participate on building the idea of each feature of the simulation game. Rica would be our Video game producer as Ricaâ€™s background is within Business major in Accounting so she would have the ability to do our financials such as budgeting our project and develop a marketing plan for our project. Nikita, Nanako and Angela would be our Programmers and Game Designers. These members have the knowledge and experience with HTML and CSS elements due to their tertiary assessments. Assigning Angela as one of our Game Designer benefits her as her ideal job is to become Senior Game Developer. With this project she has a chance to enhance her skills in game development that she would bring throughout her career. For Level Designer Nikita, Nanako, Angela and Rica would work together to brainstorm and research some ideas about economic disasters that has happen in 2020 and think of solutions that we can share with the potential players. Leo and Ziqiang would be our Sound Engineer and Game Tester. Ziqiang and Leo are big gamers and this hobby has benefit for them as our game tester as they would be able to compare our simulation so the other similar simulation in the market. </p>
