<h1>Zi</h1>
<p>The group is very good with separating work between each other, everyone gets to think about the parts they want to do. Also everyone is willing to help others in their work, when others have problems they find hard to deal with. The thing that needs more improvement is that we should have more group meetings, because it is close to the end of the semester there are a bunch of assignments due during the time of this assignment, our group didn't have a lot of group meetings. Everyone is kind of busy with some test and assignment. It brings some worry on if the assignment can be done in time. The surprising things is that for our group even if someone have very different idea, through group discuss we can mix them together very well, and produce an idea that combine both of the opinion. In this group I learn that before disagreeing with other people's work you should ask them about it in detail, you might find that their idea can be related to your ideas and they can work together very well. </p>

<p>One thing that this group does well is everyone is always ready and willing to help out if need be. The group is super forgiving for mistakes and always ready to help. Everyone always offers to either take some of the stress of someone else's shoulders or do specific parts for someone else due to other classes or assignments. However, this group does tend to start later when it comes to group projects or work. Group meetings and other project related write ups have always been crammed at the end of the assignment period which isn't necessarily a great habit to do. A surprising feature about this group is how well we work together as a team. Over past few assignments with the same group, it is so nice to have a group that works so well and have the same energy. I learned that sometimes having people with different ideas, opinions and views can be super helpful as it gives a fresh set of eyes towards an issue or project. </p>

<p>My reflection to our group- Trevor’s Angels with Assignment 3 has been great and all under control. The communication between us was still easy and convenient. During our meetings everyone was able to be online and tried their best to share different ideas on how to tackle Assignment 3 as it has more part that we were required to answer. I am still grateful that our level of motivation is still the same as when we did our assignment 2. The downside with this assignment is that this week has been busy for all of us as it is the last week for Semester 1 and it was hard to find time to do the our meetings, so we do really need to be able to balance our tasks for our subjects, as in the future I believe the workload would be much more than what we have now. This time I learned that in the group there is going to be a lot of ideas and opinions that each one of us will contribute that can lead to disagreements, but there is a way to avoid it, communication and reflect on both sides, see the pros and cons of both ideas. </p>

<p>Once again, working with Trevor’s angels has been a pleasure, it is nice for all of us to get along and enjoy our meetings on a base level. Generally, everyone would respond to messages within the chat, and show up for meetings to ensure we are on the same page throughout our assignment. Once again, we worked relatively individually, which was based upon our trust from the last assignment and communicated through our meetings. At some points I was worried as I hoped everyone was progressing alright as we all had relatively large tasks to handle each however each member seemed to handle their work. The use of these online meetings is extremely useful in holding my attention whereas text messages can become forgotten as they pile up. Once again however, submitting the assignment was left later than what it could have been, but at the same time, we all had multiple assignments we were completing simultaneously which we would communicate to each other. </p>

<h1>Nanako</h1>
<p>I think Trevor’s Angel is a really good group.  As we work through Assignment 2 and 3. Helping a lot to each other and when someone not sure about something, feel free to ask each other. The thing that could be improved is maybe having communication more usually. Something like if we have 3 weeks we decide which part we going to work on and keep working on my own self. And having communication once a few days to check how everyone is going. Surprising about the work is done really smoothly, without stuck at some part and messed up. Because the team members are having good communication and feel free to ask for help. The thing I learned about the group is this group is a good group because it set the time and where we are going on so everyone has their work need to work on. So everyone can understand which part they are working on and decide the day and time first so easier to contact each other. Also, to have good teamwork need to contact each other more and to help each other. I think this is the point work well for both assignment 2 and 3. </p>

<h1>Angela</h1>
<p>My experience with my group, Trevor’s Angels, has been positive all throughout. There is good communication and organizational skills between all of us. We were successfully able to work together in completing the project and have everything completed. There was not much worry from my side as I find the group to be trustworthy, and even if there were to be worries, they would be discussed since the group is so open to discussion. There were many times where I asked questions and asked for help and someone in the team had offered to give me a hand. The submission of the assignment was submitted later than I’d hoped, however it does not deflect from any work and effort put into the project by each member. I’ve learnt that discussing things with members is highly valuable as it can give new insights and ideas and broaden ideas. </p>
<h1>Group Statement</h1>
<h1>What went well</h1>
<p>Since that everyone is familiar with each other, no one dare to hesitate to ask for help, which create the work atmosphere very easy and created a strong bond between the group. So everyone feels more relaxed to work on. Everyone is willing to participate in all the group activities, no slacking and always can rely to everyone. From working together in assignment 2, the group member all has a good understand of what each other’s strength and weakness is, so assigning the work between the group was done quickly. </p>

<h1>Improvements</h1>
<p>The time we started the assignment was late, as we waited for our tutor’s feedback from our Assignment 2. Week 12 has been busy as well due to the workload we have from other subjects so the time to do it wasn’t very long, therefore we needed to improve our time management skills.  This can also help us improve on when and how often we have meetings as we left them all the meetings necessary for the assignment at the end. If we did have more consistent meetings, workload could have been managed better and possibly had a better outcome regarding timing of work and submission. </p>

<h1>Surprising moments</h1>
<p>The surprising part is how the team are working together really well despite on how busy each other as we have different commitments in our studies. This group tries their hardest to catch up together to do the meetings. The level of energy and motivation of each member is till the same from the beginning.  We all kept the same positivity and laughing since we met in week 1 of university.  </p>

<h1>One thing that we learned about the group</h1>
<p>During the discussion we have a lot of different idea and opinion coming up and from talking about it in a group, we get to agree on some ideas and it boost our creativity on the topic .Through this we learn that different idea and opinion are also helpful for the project. The opinions and views of everyone in this group really helped inspired each other to brainstorm off everyone which helped coming up with certain project elements easy. Communication is very important in a group. Active communication can boost team motivation and efficient use of time. </p>
