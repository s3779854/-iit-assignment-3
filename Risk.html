<h1>Risk</h1>
<p>It is very important to realise the risk that would occur during the development of the game and make ways to avoid them. For a project money is always something to consider. First we need to find a investor to fund the money so we don't run into a budget risk. After that the team need to put their ideas it to the form of a game. It would be kind of hard to implement everything in the early stage. Even if the feature of the game is planned out, when developing the game there is the chance of finding issues that are not identified earlier. Some conflict between the feature might be found during the process.It would be time wasting to go over everything and a huge struggle to meet the deadline from the investor. Even when releasing the game it is quite important to choose the right advertisement method, if the publicity is not in place, no one would notice the game, but if the feature in the advertisement doesn't show as advertised it would cause bad effects too.   Furthermore the platform to release the game in will influence the popularity of the game. The game would not grant success if those requirements are not met.</p>
