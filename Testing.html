<h1>Testing</h1>
<p>Game testing is the most important part in a game development process.It is crucial let the user have a feel of how the game would be like, so the developer can know that they are not put the work into nothing. On the other hand, testing also ensure the game don't have game breaking that would resolve in huge financial lost. Before releasing anything decide a suitable user group for the game. Then post survey out with good screener questions so it can reach to the relevant user group. And then anaylise the data from the survey. After finishing analysing the answer, find the participant that have interesting answer that you want to get in more deep.Find 15 to 20 and set up a interview with them and during the interview ask him in more detail and collectn their contact. After implement the change, contact the participant before, let them do an alpha test, and give them some task to complete, set time for each task, whethere they finish the task or not let them give short feedback after the time end. Record the process and result of each test. Put in the detail learned and make the final beta version.</p>
