<h1>Testing</h1>
<p>Game testing is the most important part in a game development process.It is crucial to let the user have a feel of how the game would be, so the developer can know that they are not putting the work into nothing. On the other hand, testing also ensures the game doesn't have game breaking that would result in huge financial loss. Before releasing anything decide a suitable user group for the game. Then post a survey out with good screener questions so it can reach the relevant user group. And then analyse the data from the survey. After finishing analysing the answer, find the participant that has an interesting answer that you want to get in more deep.Find 15 to 20 and set up an interview with them and during the interview ask him in more detail and collect their contact information. After implementing the change, contact the participant before, let them do an alpha test, and give them some task to complete, set time for each task, whether they finish the task or not let them give short feedback after the time ends. Record the process and result of each test. Put in the detail learned and make the final beta version.</p>
