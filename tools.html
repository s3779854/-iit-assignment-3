                    <p>The trail on our Git repository is once again not an accurate description of the timeline of our work, as all of our resources were compiled together on the same day, rather than gradual updates. The main reason of this is because of the nature of the assignment being primarily research based. While conducting research, we were mainly uploading our work to an office365 document. 
                    </p>
                    <p>Once we were satisfied, we would translate our information to HTML, and then finally to the repository, where the CSS file would transform and display our website as intended.

                    <p>In terms of the software tools required, our game is intended to run on the unity engine (current version Unity 2019.3.15)</p>
                    <p> All members of the group are inexperienced with the unity engine and its language(C++), therefore we are required to hire experience workers for our program of which are capable of bringing our vision to life!</p>
