<h1>Plans And Progress</h1>
<p>The following section will detail the planning and progression of the project and the logic the group went through in order to develop a concept for our project. The following paragraphs will detail the conceptualization of the project, the original plan and the justifications of the project idea, any adjustments made to the initial project plan, and the eventual project plan we as a group decided to settle with towards the very end. There will also be guidelines made to detail what steps will be taken towards achieving the final product.</p>

<h2>Conceptualization</h2>
<p>The first thing was to decide what was wanted as a group and establish a project idea. The group arranged a meeting and decided to pitch in multiple ideas for the project by sharing project ideas made from the previous assignment 1. Originally, there was no clear direction for the project, but it was made clear that the group was open to many ideas and was open to discussion on different concepts with project ideas including a game and an interactive AI robot being suggested. However, after further discussion and contemplation, a consensus was reached that a game would be the medium, due to the common interests between team-members.</p>
<p>Two individuals of the group had mentioned that their previous project ideas were a game, however, they differed in goal. One individual’s project idea pursued to be an educational tool while the other aimed to be a game for leisure, which gave one of the team-members the idea to combine the two to make a game that was educational but also have leisurely aspects. While the medium of the project was being discussed, the topic of global economy was also being discussed as the focal topic for the project, but there was no real intention for such. It was randomly chosen from the list of issues to address. It was after brainstorming further on the topic, that it seemed suitable to continue with this topic as it proved to be relevant with ongoing events in the world which will be discussed in further detail onwards.</p>
<p> After the brainstorming of what kind of medium was wanted and what topic was to be covered, the type of game was to be considered. The first idea that was brought up was a simulation-type game and it was chosen immediately as it seemed logical to conclude that the economy would be best shown through a simulation game for education, however the group did not elaborate further on the game type, which proved to be an issue that will be discussed later. Due to global economics being a real-world issue, it seemed suitable to be able to simulate it in a fictional environment in order to interact with the economy and see how it can change with certain interactions and it would especially be able to relate with current events, like coronavirus and its effects the global economy. </p>

<h2>The Initial Plan</h2>
<p>After further discussion in the meeting it was concluded that the project idea was decided on being a game that addresses the issues with the real-world economy by simulating a fictional version of it within the game, in order to educate the player. The game would tackle many issues that arise with the international exchange of goods and services in which the user will be tasked to manage and take care of. To manage the economy, the user would be responsible to regulate the economy by adjusting aspects of it, which the game will respond appropriately by correlating such changes to real-world events that have occurred. The goal of the game would be to show the user the potential life-altering effects just small changes have on the economy, and the nature of its existence. </p>
<p>With this initial project idea being made, there were already major constraints considered. Like it being difficult to address all issues regarding the world’s economy due to the gigantic scope of the world (and the project), which is an issue that will be further expanded on and fixed later. At this point, it was intended that the game would feature the economy in general to combat this issue and represent recent events, so it felt relevant, valuable and intriguing to the player. </p>
<p>From there, a list of real-world economic issues was compiled that seemed relevant to address within the game and would be features of the game that would be affecting the simulated world. The following economic problems and their brief descriptions were of such: </p>

<ul>
    <li>The effects of diseases on global economy, including the recent Coronavirus pandemic. The global economy is not exempt from the fear and panic manifesting as disease continues to spread across nations. 

    Exportation and importation of goods and services will become restrained as supply chains cannot be accessed due to strict border limitations and small businesses will be suspended due to lack of revenue. 
        
    The principle of supply-and-demand. Demand for essential items will rise however supply will remain stagnant which will inflate the prices while non-essential items will decrease as there will be less demand of such luxuries, thus negatively impacting companies that gross high amounts of money from selling such products. 
        
    Because of the instability of the economy, the government will be pressured to fund local companies and individuals to keep the country from further breakdown.</li>
    <li>Similarly, natural disasters are just as unpredictable and deadly to the economy. With recent news of natural disasters, there are many resources and money expended to help recover from crisis. For example, yearly devastating Australian bushfires bring economic shortcomings. The effect of the bushfires deal great damage to industries such as farming and tourism, and there needs to be billions of dollars funneled from the government into extinguish fires and rebuilding communities.</li>
    <li>Climate change is also a big factor that would control the economy. The overuse of natural resources would have various severe consequences on humans. </li>
    <li>Overall, such natural phenomena have an acute impact on global economy as it can materialize at seemingly random times and send the global economy into turmoil in an instant. Depending on moderation, communities may not be well-equipped or prepared to deal with such disaster and it will leave an undeniably huge impact on the economy.</li>
    <li>Something that also threatens the economy are man-made causes. Economic instability is encouraged by the ongoing tension growing between countries and regions. With different world leaders and prominent figures, they have a lot of power over the world’s economy and can manipulate it easier. With different people comes different motives, views, goals and policies regarding the economy which causes conflict between communities. This can bring about conflict, political uprisings, civil unrest and in the most severe cases, war. For example, in 2020, Brexit took a big shock to the economy. And shortly later in the same year the trade war between China and the United State caused more stock market instability.</li>
    <li>There is a concept known as “debt wave” characterized by companies and organizations borrowing money from the government in order to use it in their big project investment. This can have a positive effect on the economy, however from the statistics produced by world bank (2020), the world GDP have grown for 4% in 2019, but at the same time the debt has grown for 6%. As shown the number of debts is growing faster than the economic growth. This can produce another global financial crisis due to the big economic bubble made by this debt wave.</li>
    <li>There are many more crises and causes for global economic pressure including famine, poverty, overpopulation, war and corruption. </li>
</ul>

<p>There would be two modes available in the game: one where the user can freely test and demonstrate events, and a campaign event where the user must deal with randomly generated events by the game and try to salvage the situation. For the campaign mode, the goal for the user will be trying to upkeep the peace of the world economy, and the game will end when the world goes into disarray or lack of adequate funding to spend, signifying failure. It should be noted at this point of the project, there wasn’t any specific criteria set out yet in order to know what counted as a game-over, which would be an issue in further developing the project. </p>
<p>Randomly triggered events can consist of natural or man-made causes. An example of a natural cause would be a tsunami hitting the coast of a very influential area, like Japan. The program, to be as accurate as possible, will retrieve information from Google of similar events and relay that data into the game for the user to interpret, and the user, with the role as a ‘world leader’ will decide how to deal with the situation. Actions that can be taken by the user could possibly be taking funds from somewhere else and funneling it towards the natural disaster relief. However, with taking funds from another place, there will be consequences, like that place going into instability or having severe losses. An example of a man-made cause could be the tensions arising between two areas, and them deciding to cut all economic ties. Just like the previous scenario, this would be out of the user’s control, and they will have to be able to work around the economic losses and keep sustaining it. </p>
<p>However still, in this initial but more detailed and expanded plan of the project, there were constraints that did not have a fix yet. These constraints were that the game would simply not enough data out there to predict what will happen when a specific event happens and it’d be too generalized, as deviations can occur, and events and their outcomes can be very circumstantial. It was thought at this point, that even with these flaws in the game, it would be a good starting point for users who do not want to delve into news articles to learn about real-world events, and to be able to take it slowly or educate themselves with a fun, interactive experience. </p>
<h2>Dead ends, Adjustments, Revisions </h2>
    <p>Originally there was not much structure to the game that had been planned out, besides the team knowing it would be a simulation of some sort of the real-world economy. There was no reference point discussed when the idea was first made, thus it made proceeding forward difficult. After feedback from outside sources (assignment feedback), it was the group’s initiative to further develop the concept of the game instead of having it being a relative idea.  </p>
    <p>Feedback consisted of the game being of having too big of a scope and/or aspirational for the group, especially considering the constraints that were not addressed before. These constraints were the lack of definition of a ‘simulation-game’ for our specific game, the gigantic scope of the project that would make it extremely difficult to both address issues and make the game, the lack of any coherent or clear game functions and the lumping of multiple of the same type of events and therefore making it generalized despite occurrences having unique circumstances and outcomes. Feedback from a reviewer was that the game lacked any uniqueness or outstanding functionalities that would trump other games. </p>
    <p>This was the starting point for the team in considering what aspects of the project to develop on further. In thinking of ways to improve the project plan, it was eventually brought up that referencing other existing games that followed the model of a simulation game would make a good outline for our game to take inspiration from. It would easily help us outline conceivable functions in the game and functions that may not be achievable, and help the team define what a ‘simulation-game’ meant and what type we were aiming for. As such, we sourced Google in order to locate the type of game and studied 4 types of different games that identified under “simulation.” They are the following: </p>
        <ul>
           <li>Spore describes itself as a “life simulation real-time strategy God game” 
               “Spore is the latest game from the prodigious brain of Will Wright and aims to simulate the development of an entire species. The player begins the game in the form of a microscopic organism that arrives on a planet via exogenesis or panspermia, deposited in the primordial oceans by a meteorite impact.”... https://www.giantbomb.com/spore/3030-14139/ 
               
               Spore requires the user to create, manage, keep evolving and initiate gameplay as their creations in a world where the user plays in three different modes, including a 3D character controlling perspective.</li>
            <li>Plague Inc describes itself as a “real-time strategy simulation video game” 
                “Plague Inc: Evolved is a unique mix of high strategy and terrifyingly realistic simulation. Your pathogen has just infected 'Patient Zero' - now you must bring about the end of human history by evolving a deadly, global Plague whilst adapting against everything humanity can do to defend itself.”... https://www.ndemiccreations.com/en/22-plague-inc 
                
                Plague Inc requires the user to create and evolve a ‘virus’ to infect a simulated Earth through a map-view. </li>
            <li>Sims 4 describes itself as a “life simulation video game”
                “Players create a Sim character and control their life to explore different personalities which change the way the game plays out. Sims can multitask.”... 
                https://www.ea.com/games/the-sims/the-sims-4 
                
                Sims 4 requires the user to make, control, finance and build the lives of their own characters in a 3D sandbox-like simulation. </li>
            <li>Cities Skylines describes itself as a “city-building game” 
                “Cities: Skylines is a modern take on the classic city simulation. The game introduces new game play elements to realize the thrill and hardships of creating and maintaining a real city whilst expanding on some well-established tropes of the city building experience.”... 
                https://www.paradoxplaza.com/cities-skylines/CSCS00GSK-MASTER.html 
                
                Cities Skylines requires the users to create and maintain a city and its finances in a simulation similar to Sims 4’s sandbox-like simulation. </li>
        </ul>
    <p> The group took inspiration most from Plague Inc as it closely resembled what the team was imagining when the idea was conceptualized. This was also good point for the team to research what defines a “real time strategy simulation” video game. The game is actually a hybrid of both a real-time strategy (RTS) game and a simulation game and is defined using the following two terms: </p>
    <ul>
        <li>A ‘RTS’ game is defined as a game that “game does not progress incrementally in turns” which means that the game happens in real-time. </li>
        <li>And as expected, a simulation game is described as a “diverse super-category of video games" (which most likely contributed to the ambiguity of the initial plan) which are “designed to closely simulate real world activities.” </li>
    </ul>
    <p>This essentially means, that Plague Inc is a game that simulates a real-life scenario in real-time. With this discovery, a very realistic scenario can be emulated with a RTS simulation game, and therefore proved to be the best suited option than other game-types listed above. The other options, Cities Skylines’, Spore and Sims 4’s while similar in gameplay, did not have the game design that would suit the group’s simulation game in graphics and were more heavily based around the building an ecosystem rather than inflicting events as gameplay and observing the inflictions, like Plague Inc.  </p>
    <p>It was also considered that the other types of games (not Plague Inc) would be too complex to try to take inspiration from as Plague Inc has simpler graphic design than the other games, which all had 3D models for their graphics. The games also did not have the full view of the game at disposal as users are required to navigate around the world. While in Plague Inc, there is one constant static area for the user to be in. This static area would be beneficial for the game if it were to be made, as it would be more effective for the player to see all the operations ongoing in the map at once to get a grasp of situations in their simulation. </p>
    <p>With the game now inspired by another game, the criticism that the initial project idea wasn’t unique becomes more apparent as it risks being a copy of the original source. The project plan needed to be further changed in order to compensate.  It was decided that two constraints were to be dealt with which was that it is hard to address all issues in the world and that there are nuances and exceptions to events in the world, so there would be a struggle to be accurate in depicting reactions from the game if the group were to generalize/standardize all specific events into one thing. For example, the financial fallout from wars differ from severity, and the scale of the war. And even then, there would still be differences regardless due to everything being unique. With the original plan being to keep track of all major world events and the data associated with it that have occurred throughout history, it would be inconceivable as a group to carry out. This lead the project plan to a dead-end as the goal could not be completed. </p>
    <p>The solution to this, however, was quickly made so that the simulation exclusive to just one year, that way it could be fine-tuned to be a legitimate education tool with the analysis of just one year of history. The decision would be to create a game that would simulate the year 2020 and its events. This is where the uniqueness and meaningfulness that the initial plan lacked surfaces, as pinpointing a certain year would show very specific events and timelines that occurred in a specific year of history. This is likely to make the game being developed an invaluable source to individuals in the future since it will document events like the Coronavirus pandemic, the presidential 2020 election and the impacts of natural disasters that have exceeded previous severities on the global economy. It will be relevant to those once the game comes out due to the recency of the events, and forever be relevant for years to come since it doesn’t generalize all the world events into one entity with no sufficient data backed to it, it would instead take real data from the real world in the year 2020 and keep it contained there. Not only will this change make it outstanding to other simulation games, it would also be able to lessen the aforementioned constraints of both accuracy and scope, by reducing the size of world events into just one year and having events being less generalized as a result.  </p>
<h2>An Improved Project Plan </h2>
    <p>The project idea now has specific data to use for the game, and the game’s functions are able to be expanded on as a result of this. Instead of the initial game plan being the collection of all significant world events, instead it would be significant events occurring in 2020. The player will be able to see the ‘what ifs’ and ‘whatnots’ of events occurring in 2020 and be able to experiment with it. This seemed less grandiose of a project, but it was finally achievable in terms of features/functions of the game and conceivable for a small team of six individuals to produce. It would finally become a project with true definition of what it wanted to be as the only events that will occur in the game simulation would be events that had occurred in 2020, which includes extensive focus on the Coronavirus. </p>
    <p>There would be one mode where it is a free-for-all where the user can do things without the game giving game-over sequences. The game will allow the user to choose from a list of events that could happen and click them, to see how the world reacts to it. The game will also supply information about the specific event that occurred in 2020 as a ways for education. These events could stack up on each other or be intensified for the user to see the potential effects the world could have taken as a result. </p>
    <p>The other mode would be the campaign more, similarly to before, where the user tries to upkeep the world economy by doing specific things to save it. Depending on what they do, will be a game over if the world economy is in collapse. What counted as a ‘failure’ was previously not elaborated upon and is still a constraint in the project. So there has been research put into the followings concepts that would count as a ‘collapse’ which relate closely to real world economics: </p>
    <ul>
        <li> Extreme Inflation. While inflation has happened constantly throughout history, it is usually not a good sign for the economy when it occurs. Inflation is usually a byproduct of when prices rise due to production costs increasing on resources like raw materials and wages of people. High demand in products and services with little supply can also cause inflation. When the economy inflates, all the prices are essentially rising and the cost to live has increased, and it may not be affordable to many people. This could mean a number of things can happen to the world economy, as inflation can cause a domino effect. </li>
        <li>An economic recession. An economic recession is characterized as a “long-term downturn in economic activity in one or more economies.” When the population begins to slow down production of services, the economy is unable to sustain itself as less things will be going on. This will mean that the GDP will lower and the global economy slows down. At this point, there wouldn’t be much of an economy to simulate.</li>
        <li>There is no more money left in the world. While this may not be feasible in real life, for the purpose of gameplay, the user will have to manage resources effectively in order to upkeep the economy. Any misuse of the player’s power can ultimately cause the player to lose money.  </li>
    </ul>
    <p>On top of having two game-modes, a third mode would actually simulate 2020 as it went on. Since the game would try to be an accurate representation of 2020, it allows this mode of the game to demonstrate the progress of the entire year for educational purposes and would be interactive, so the player can learn about the events as things unfolded.</p>
    <p>There are many things going on, so it is important for use to understand the economic issues around us. With specific problems and scenarios discussed, the game will now have lots of content for the player to experiment with in order to educate themselves. The user will be able to control and monitor what occurs in the simulation, and therefore carry out sets of tasks to either fix the economy or send it further into destruction. </p>
    <p>Ideally, the game would be crafted in a game engine suitable for beginner game developers. A candidate for this could be the Unity engine as there are many readily available resources, since it is a very popular game development software. As for the graphics for the game, our group can opt to purchasing pre-made assets, so we do not need to generate our own graphics, making the development stage much quicker and having much more refined graphics, versus having amateur self-made graphics. </p>
    <p>The project is planned to be conducted in intervals throughout the year of 2020 until next year, since there still needs to be documentation of any potential other events that would occur in 2020, for example, the US presidential election. With a game like this being developed, it would take an extreme amount of effort taken into researching events and the fundamentals of economics in order for it to be as accurate as possible for the audience, so doing extensive research of events as they occur throughout the year would mean the project would guarantee the best possible accuracy. Other aspects of the project that can be developed independently like graphics can be started on in the year, and eventually after 2020 when all the events would have occurred, the team could spend a few more months researching on the last events before the project is finally pieced together by coding events into Unity and refined. </p>
    <p>Because it is a project that will detail the events of 2020, it will be relevant if it were to be released in 2021, for individuals that were curious on the major events that occurred that year, but regardless it would also be a relevant resource for those years and years later as it will educate them on the impacts that 2020 had on the entire world in that year, and subsequently the future, or it would be just an educational tool for them to learn about a very influential year in history.</p>
    <p>A more specific span of this timeline will be expanded in the timeframe section. </p>
