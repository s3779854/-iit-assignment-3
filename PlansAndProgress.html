<h1>Plans And Progress</h1>
<p>The following section will detail the planning and progression of the project and the logic the group went through in order to develop a concept for our project. The following paragraphs will detail the conceptualization of the project, the original plan and the justifications of the project idea, any adjustments made to the initial project plan, and the eventual project plan we as a group decided to settle with towards the very end. There will also be guidelines made to detail what steps will be taken towards achieving the final product.</p>

<h1>Conceptualization</h1>
<p>The first thing was to decide what was wanted as a group and establish a project idea. The group arranged a meeting and decided to pitch in multiple ideas for the project by sharing project ideas made from the previous assignment 1. Originally, there was no clear direction for the project, but it was made clear that the group was open to many ideas and was open to discussion on different concepts with project ideas including a game and an interactive AI robot being suggested. However, after further discussion and contemplation, a consensus was reached that a game would be the medium, due to the common interests between team-members.</p>
<p>Two individuals of the group had mentioned that their previous project ideas were a game, however, they differed in goal. One individual’s project idea pursued to be an educational tool while the other aimed to be a game for leisure, which gave one of the team-members the idea to combine the two to make a game that was educational but also have leisurely aspects. While the medium of the project was being discussed, the topic of global economy was also being discussed as the focal topic for the project, but there was no real intention for such. It was randomly chosen from the list of issues to address. It was after brainstorming further on the topic, that it seemed suitable to continue with this topic as it proved to be relevant with ongoing events in the world which will be discussed in further detail onwards.</p>
<p> After the brainstorming of what kind of medium was wanted and what topic was to be covered, the type of game was to be considered. The first idea that was brought up was a simulation-type game and it was chosen immediately as it seemed logical to conclude that the economy would be best shown through a simulation game for education, however the group did not elaborate further on the game type, which proved to be an issue that will be discussed later. Due to global economics being a real-world issue, it seemed suitable to be able to simulate it in a fictional environment in order to interact with the economy and see how it can change with certain interactions and it would especially be able to relate with current events, like coronavirus and its effects the global economy. </p>

<h1>The Initial Plan</h1>
<p>After further discussion in the meeting it was concluded that the project idea was decided on being a game that addresses the issues with the real-world economy by simulating a fictional version of it within the game, in order to educate the player. The game would tackle many issues that arise with the international exchange of goods and services in which the user will be tasked to manage and take care of. To manage the economy, the user would be responsible to regulate the economy by adjusting aspects of it, which the game will respond appropriately by correlating such changes to real-world events that have occurred. The goal of the game would be to show the user the potential life-altering effects just small changes have on the economy, and the nature of its existence. </p>
<p>With this initial project idea being made, there were already major constraints considered. Like it being difficult to address all issues regarding the world’s economy due to the gigantic scope of the world (and the project), which is an issue that will be further expanded on and fixed later. At this point, it was intended that the game would feature the economy in general to combat this issue and represent recent events, so it felt relevant, valuable and intriguing to the player. </p>
<p>From there, a list of real-world economic issues was compiled that seemed relevant to address within the game and would be features of the game that would be affecting the simulated world. The following economic problems and their brief descriptions were of such: </p>

<ul>
    <li>The effects of diseases on global economy, including the recent Coronavirus pandemic. The global economy is not exempt from the fear and panic manifesting as disease continues to spread across nations. 

    Exportation and importation of goods and services will become restrained as supply chains cannot be accessed due to strict border limitations and small businesses will be suspended due to lack of revenue. 
        
    The principle of supply-and-demand. Demand for essential items will rise however supply will remain stagnant which will inflate the prices while non-essential items will decrease as there will be less demand of such luxuries, thus negatively impacting companies that gross high amounts of money from selling such products. 
        
    Because of the instability of the economy, the government will be pressured to fund local companies and individuals to keep the country from further breakdown.</li>
    <li>Similarly, natural disasters are just as unpredictable and deadly to the economy. With recent news of natural disasters, there are many resources and money expended to help recover from crisis. For example, yearly devastating Australian bushfires bring economic shortcomings. The effect of the bushfires deal great damage to industries such as farming and tourism, and there needs to be billions of dollars funneled from the government into extinguish fires and rebuilding communities.</li>
    <li>Climate change is also a big factor that would control the economy. The overuse of natural resources would have various severe consequences on humans. </li>
    <li>Overall, such natural phenomena have an acute impact on global economy as it can materialize at seemingly random times and send the global economy into turmoil in an instant. Depending on moderation, communities may not be well-equipped or prepared to deal with such disaster and it will leave an undeniably huge impact on the economy.</li>
    <li>Something that also threatens the economy are man-made causes. Economic instability is encouraged by the ongoing tension growing between countries and regions. With different world leaders and prominent figures, they have a lot of power over the world’s economy and can manipulate it easier. With different people comes different motives, views, goals and policies regarding the economy which causes conflict between communities. This can bring about conflict, political uprisings, civil unrest and in the most severe cases, war. For example, in 2020, Brexit took a big shock to the economy. And shortly later in the same year the trade war between China and the United State caused more stock market instability.</li>
    <li>There is a concept known as “debt wave” characterized by companies and organizations borrowing money from the government in order to use it in their big project investment. This can have a positive effect on the economy, however from the statistics produced by world bank (2020), the world GDP have grown for 4% in 2019, but at the same time the debt has grown for 6%. As shown the number of debts is growing faster than the economic growth. This can produce another global financial crisis due to the big economic bubble made by this debt wave.</li>
    <li>There are many more crises and causes for global economic pressure including famine, poverty, overpopulation, war and corruption. </li>
</ul>

<p>There would be two modes available in the game: one where the user can freely test and demonstrate events, and a campaign event where the user must deal with randomly generated events by the game and try to salvage the situation. For the campaign mode, the goal for the user will be trying to upkeep the peace of the world economy, and the game will end when the world goes into disarray or lack of adequate funding to spend, signifying failure. It should be noted at this point of the project, there wasn’t any specific criteria set out yet in order to know what counted as a game-over, which would be an issue in further developing the project. </p>
<p>Randomly triggered events can consist of natural or man-made causes. An example of a natural cause would be a tsunami hitting the coast of a very influential area, like Japan. The program, to be as accurate as possible, will retrieve information from Google of similar events and relay that data into the game for the user to interpret, and the user, with the role as a ‘world leader’ will decide how to deal with the situation. Actions that can be taken by the user could possibly be taking funds from somewhere else and funneling it towards the natural disaster relief. However, with taking funds from another place, there will be consequences, like that place going into instability or having severe losses. An example of a man-made cause could be the tensions arising between two areas, and them deciding to cut all economic ties. Just like the previous scenario, this would be out of the user’s control, and they will have to be able to work around the economic losses and keep sustaining it. </p>
<p>However still, in this initial but more detailed and expanded plan of the project, there were constraints that did not have a fix yet. These constraints were that the game would simply not enough data out there to predict what will happen when a specific event happens and it’d be too generalized, as deviations can occur, and events and their outcomes can be very circumstantial. It was thought at this point, that even with these flaws in the game, it would be a good starting point for users who do not want to delve into news articles to learn about real-world events, and to be able to take it slowly or educate themselves with a fun, interactive experience. </p>
