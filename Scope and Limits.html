<h1>Scope and Limits</h1>
<p>For this project, the entire scope for our game would include the design of the levels and scenarios for the said levels. The concepts of possibly different types of scenarios such as natural disasters, to give the unpredictability aspect, climate change, resources that give society consequences based on level of use, and man-made scenarios that could cause trouble in the economical industry. Within the time constraints, only including specific scenarios, possibly one or two from each category so we can show within a proof of the concept for investors. Due to time limits, incorporating more natural disasters and other types of scenarios as it will be added features over time of the development. 
The designs of the project for the modes which are casual mode and campaign mode. For the sake of timing of the project, casual game mode would be the easiest to implement as it will give the user free range of testing and demonstrating the scenarios. Another limitation would be assets. Due to timing and funding, assets would most likely be purchased to save time, funding and because of professional skill set.
